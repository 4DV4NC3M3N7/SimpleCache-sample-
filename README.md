# SimpleCache
## Simple cache design implementation in verilog

Completed parts of a project are stored in the "Completed Parts" folder.
Every complete part has comments for all actions, succesfully compiles, and works with other stored modules.

Simple Cache implementation shoud have 5 workable modules:
* ram 			-supporting module which provides data for cache
* ram_tb			-testbench for ram
* cache			-simple cache implementation (Direct-mapped cache)
* cache_tb		-testbench for cache
* demonstrative module [^1]	-module to show how other modules perfectly work with each other

Full descriptions for every module:

[^1]: Optional to show something with use of FPGA
